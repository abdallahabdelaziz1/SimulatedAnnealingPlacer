# SimulatedAnnealingPlacer

This project is a simple simulated annealing-based placer that minimizes the total wirelength. It studies the effect of cooling rate on the quality of the placement.

To run the program, compile the C++ code and run the executable. You will be asked to enter the test name and the cooling rate. Note that you need to have the test file in the same directory as the executable.

The project prints the initial placement and wire lenght. Then it optimizes the placement and prints the final placement and total wire length.
